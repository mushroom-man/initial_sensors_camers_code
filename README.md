# Mushroom Growing
This is multi-part project that aims at using machine learning to 
optimise and control the growing parameters within a mushroom chamber. This 
part of the project is for the fruiting of the mushrooms. I envisage this 
part as having 4 parts:
1) Data Collection
2) Training a machine learning algorithm on the growth parameters
3) Training a machine learning algorithm to track mushroom growth 
through digital images
4) Making the growth parameter algorithm and the CV algorithm interact so that
the CV algorithm is guiding the growth parameters though the growth cycle
